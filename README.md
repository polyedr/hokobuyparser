# hokobuyparser
Hokobuy parser written with Python scraping framework Scrapy
The hokobuy front-end was built with React, so, to parse the website, Splash software should be installed for your system, https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash
After this, parsing hokobuy Javascript (React) generated website is relatively easy.
With the webspider presented I used list of initial urls, but you can implement pagination for your website parser, and when you will do this, if the front of the website is based on Javascript, use Splash requests to follow pagination links, too.
